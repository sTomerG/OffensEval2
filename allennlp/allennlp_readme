# Installation notes local:

https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/README.md#installation

It was necessary to update conda for it to work. Also init the bash shell:

conda init bash
conda create -n allennlp python=3.6
conda activate allennlp

# Peregrine installation notes:

First load Anaconda module
	module load Anaconda3

Need to install with --user and need to add /home/p266548/.local/bin/ to $PATH in .bashrc
When running a shell script (e.g. pipeline.sh), add:
	module load Anaconda3
	. /software/software/Anaconda3/5.3.0/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
	conda activate allennlp

# Generating config files you can do interactively in the browser

# Run this on local pc (not peregrine):
	allennlp configure
# Then go to browser 
http://localhost:8123/

Note that for embedding you have to fill something in for the empty text field ("tokens")
There can be more issues with the interactive config file, just check error messages

Train as:

allennlp train $JSON_FILE -s $EXP_FOLDER

# For creating a new model, make sure it is registered, but also imported in the __init__.py file in the model directory
/home/p266548/anaconda3/envs/allennlp/lib/python3.6/site-packages/allennlp/models/encoder_decoders/__init__.py (for example)
